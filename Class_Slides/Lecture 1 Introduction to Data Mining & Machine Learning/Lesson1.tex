\section{Introduction to Mahcine Learning}
\begin{frame}{Machine Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Definition: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming.

\begin{frame}{Types of Machine Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Supervised Learning: Involves training a model on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known. Examples include classification and regression tasks.
        \item Unsupervised Learning: Involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the system identifies patterns and structures without predefined labels. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
        \item Reinforcement Learning: Involves training an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
